Tutorial Kinetic Analysis
*************************

First of all, lets load Pynoramix in our script or in a ipython session:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

     In [1]: from pynoramix_beta import *


Some basic notions on python will be assumed along this tutorial. 


.. If you just landed here without any idea on python, have a look to the section *First steps on python*.
.. coment todo:: Make a short tutorial on python, enough to run pynoramix.

----------------------

1D Trajectories
===============

Given a 1D trajectory , its kinetic analysis can be done taking advantage of the class *kinetic_1D_analysis*. 
The following subsections are a description of how to deal with this class and the functions included.

.. seealso:: The section XXX for the details of this function.


Loading a trajectory
++++++++++++++++++++

Given a file, :download:`traj.oup
<../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/traj.oup.gz>`, with the 1D
trajectory in its second column, the class *kinetic_1D_analysis* can
be initialized:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [2]: kin_test=kinetic_1D_analysis('traj.oup',column=1)
   # Trajectory loaded: 999901 time steps

Now, the trajectory is stored in the object kin_test:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [3]: print 'Column', kin_test.file_column, 'in file', kin_test.file_name
   Column 1 in file traj.oup

   In [4]: print kin_test.num_particles, 'particles  with', kin_test.dimensions,\
      ...:       'dimension', ':', kin_test.length, 'time steps.'
   1 particles with 1 dimension: 999901 time steps.

   In [5]: print kin_test.traj[:]
   [-0.91936072  0.74886578 -1.07525923 ..., -9.09667346 -8.40884264 -8.83918787]

Since the trajectory is a numpy.ndarray, we can take adventage of its numpy intrinsic attributes and functions:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [6]: print 'Min.:',kin_test.traj.min(),'   Mean:', kin_test.traj.mean() ,\
      ...:       '   Max.:', kin_test.traj.max()
   Min.: -11.4344662381    Mean: -3.40808122446    Max.: 2.78106514618

The histogram can be obtained with the following command:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [7]: hxx,hyy=kin_test.histogram(delta_x=0.20,segment=[-12.0,4.0],norm=False)

   In [8]: import pylab as pylab

   In [9]: pylab.plot(hxx,hyy,'b-')
   Out[10]: [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x43277d0>]

   In [11]: pylab.show()

   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %

First order kinetic model
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

At first glance the former distribution can be decompose in three
peaks, called macro-states since we know that this histogram is coming
from a dynamical system. Actually, the trajectory corresponds to the
projection onto an arbitrary coordinate of a langevin dynamics of a
particle embeded in a 2D potential.

.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/histo_color.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %

According to this first superficial analysis, the particle moves
through a landscape with 3 basins (green, orange, blue) separated by 2
barriers (green-orange and orange-blue). Thereby, the particle goes
from green to blue region bymeans of a necessary visit to the region orange. 

A first order kinetic model can be computed with these three
states. The model should be written as a master equation where the
transition probabilities, or rates, between macrostates interplay to
mimic the macroscopical dynamical behavior observed in the experiment.

These transition probabilities are computed from the following trajectory:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [6]: for xx in kin_test.traj[:]:
      ...:     if xx <=-5.5:
      ...:          kin_test.traj_clusters.append(0)   # Green region
      ...:     elif xx <=-2.3:
      ...:          kin_test.traj_clusters.append(1)   # Orange region
      ...:     else:
      ...:          kin_test.traj_clusters.append(2)   # Blue region
      ...: 

Notice that the term 'cluster' was used: a set of time steps belonging
to the same macrostate. This way the cluster labeled '0' corresponds
to region green, '1' to the orange one and '2' to the blue.  The
transition probabilities can be computed building the corresponding
kinetic network, or conformational space network. The trajectory is
mapped into a network where weighted nodes and directed links accounts to
the occupation of the clusters and the number of transitions among them.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [7]: kin_test.kinetic_network(traj='clusters',verbose=True)
   # Network:
   # 3 nodes
   # 9 links out
   # 999900.0 total weight nodes

Before getting the transision probabilities, or rates, detailed
balance condition is impossed symmetrising the network.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [8]: kin_test.network_clusters.symmetrize(new=False,verbose=False)

   In [9]: kin_test.network_clusters.info()
   # Network:
   # 3 nodes
   # 9 links out
   # 1999800.0 total weight nodes

.. seealso:: The section XXX for the details of this function.


The network we have now is nothing but a kinetic model respresented as a graph. This way the master equations:

.. math::

   \frac{dP_{0}}{dt} = P_{01}P_{1} + P_{02}P_{2} - P_{10}P_{0} - P_{20}P_{0},

\

.. math::

   \frac{dP_{1}}{dt} = P_{10}P_{0} + P_{12}P_{2} - P_{01}P_{1} - P_{21}P_{1},

\

.. math::

   \frac{dP_{2}}{dt} = P_{20}P_{0} + P_{21}P_{1} - P_{02}P_{2} - P_{12}P_{2},


can be written with the transition probabilities:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [10]: for ii in range(3):
      ....:    ww=kin_test.network_clusters.node[ii].weight
      ....:        for jj in range(3):
      ....:            if ii!=jj :
      ....:                print 'P'+str(jj)+str(ii)+'=', \
      ....:                      kin_test.network_clusters.node[ii].link[jj]/ww
      ....: 
   P10= 0.00134372002214
   P20= 0.000153059499211
   P01= 0.00190455529265
   P21= 0.0749385749386
   P02= 8.25724981733e-05
   P12= 0.0285230372469

Where detailed balance condition, :math:`P_{ji}P^{s}_{i}=P_{ij}P^{s}_{j}`, is
fullfilled by construction. Thereby, the stationary solution of this
master equation is given by the occupation probabilities given found
as weights of nodes.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [11]: ww=kin_test.network_clusters.weight

   In [12]: for ii in range(3):
      ....:     print 'P'+str(ii)+'^s =', kin_test.network_clusters.node[ii].weight/ww
      ....: 
   P0^s = 0.28096459646
   P1^s = 0.198228822882
   P2^s = 0.520806580658



We can now compare our kinetic model with the behavior observed in the
original trajectory.  This can be done attending to magnitudes as the
*mean dwell/life time* and its distribution or the *mean first passage
time* and its distribution.

Life time distribution
++++++++++++++++++++++

Up to here, in this tutorial we have built a kinetic model from a 1D
trajectory. Now the accuracy of the model can be checked with
observables as the life time of its macro-states.

First of all, the life time distribution of the 3 macro-states can be
computed from our clusters trajectory.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [13]: ltx_1,lty_1=kin_test.life_time(traj='clusters',state=1,norm=True,verbose=True)
   # Mean life time: 16.3446993094 frames.

   In [14]: ltx_2,lty_2=kin_test.life_time(traj='clusters',state=2,norm=True,verbose=True)
   # Mean life time: 34.0213561056 frames.

.. Note:: This analysis was applied not to the trajectory found in the
   file 'traj.oup' but to a trajectory 10 times larges.

.. Seealso:: Function for further details.

The distributions can be fitted to exponential functions:
:math:`\exp{(At+B)}`. The next plot shows the fitting together with
the distributions, where approximately A=-0.008 and B=-9.763 for
cluster 1 (orange), and A=-0.026 and B=-7.311 for cluster 2 (blue).

.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/lf_dist_bad.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %

We observe how the long time behavior fits to an exponential
distribution but **many non expected short life events appear**.

Now, we can compare with the life time distributions obtained by the
kinetic model although from the previous plot we can guess that our
clusters are not well defined. To this aim a random walker over the
kinetic network can be run according to the transition probabilities.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [15]: bw_traj=kin_test.network_clusters.brownian_walker(origin=0,length=10000000)

   In [16]: bw=kinetic_1D_analysis(bw_traj)
   # Trajectory loaded: 10000001 time steps

   In [17]: ltbw_x_1,ltbw_y_1=bw.life_time(state=1,norm=True,verbose=True)
   # Mean life time: 16.2835161764 frames.

   In [18]: ltbw_x_2,ltbw_y_2=bw.life_time(state=2,norm=True,verbose=True)
   # Mean life time: 34.1362159764 frames.

This time the distributions and their exponential fits, A=-0.068 and B=-5.504 for
cluster 1 (orange) and A=-0.029 and B=-7.034 for cluster 2 (blue), shows a different behavior:

.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/lf_dist_model_bad.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %


We can see how, **although the mean life time (in [13],[14] and
[17],[18]) are similar, the relaxations times are different from
those previously computed**. Cluster 1 (orange) has a faster
relaxation than Cluster 2 (blue). It is up to the reader trying to
understand the origin of these different behaviors, even with the same
*mlt* (check section XXX to find some help).


These observations point to the possibility of having a bad kinetic
description of our system, but before showing how to do it better,
lets check another kinetic magnitude: the *first passage time distribution*.



First Passage Time distribution
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Following the same strategy as in the previous section, we can compare
some distributions computed over the original clusters trajectory and
over its kinetic model. The first passage time distribution can be
computed to a certain state from a given state or from any one (*Global first passage time*).

The original clusters trajectory shows the following distributions for
this three different cases: the Global first passage time to cluster 2 (blue), from
cluster 0 (green) to cluster 2 and from cluster 1 (orange) to cluster 2.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [19]: fptx2,fpty2=kin_test.first_passage_time(traj='clusters',to_state=2,
      ....:   norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 700.403755073 frames.

   In [20]: fptx02,fpty02=kin_test.first_passage_time(traj='clusters',from_state=0,to_state=2,\
      ....:   norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 1175.03303483 frames.

   In [21]: fptx12,fpty12=kin_test.first_passage_time(traj='clusters',from_state=1,to_state=2,\
      ....:   norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 124.958081567 frames.


.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/fpt_bad_to2.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %

There are two things not expected in this plot. The **short time
behavior looks anomalous** and both distributions '1 to 2' and '0 to
2' should be bi-exponential. Since we made the first guest of having the
particle going from **0 to 2** with a necessary stay in cluster 1, this
distribution **should be bi-exponential**.


Now, we can compare with the first passage time distributions obtained
by the kinetic model. As it was done with the life time distributions,
a random walker over the kinetic network can be run according to the
transition probabilities.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [22]: bw_traj=kin_test.network_clusters.brownian_walker(origin=0,length=9999000)

   In [23]: bw=kinetic_1D_analysis(bw_traj,verbose=False)

   In [24]: fptbwx2, fptbwy2= bw.first_passage_time(to_state=2,\
      ....:   norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 430.700895225 frames.

   In [25]: fptbwx02,fptbwy02=bw.first_passage_time(from_state=0,to_state=2,\
      ....:   norm=False,verbose=True)	
   # Mean first passage time: 751.240082388 frames.

   In [26]: fptbwx12,fptbwy12=bw.first_passage_time(from_state=1,to_state=2,\
      ....:   norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 36.4134420305 frames.


.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/fpt_bad_to2_model.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %


This time we **at least observe a bi-exponential** behavior in the '1 to 2'
distribution in agreement with our first guess. But if we compare the
relaxation times, **by simple inspection we conclude that distributions
are different** from those obtained before from the clusters trajectory,
**even the mean first passage times are different (in [19-21] and
[24-26])**.

These analysis reinforce the idea of having a wrong analysis, the way
we have define the macro-states or cluster is not kinetically
consistent.  But before improving this analysis, let see one kinetic
observable more: what we have define as *first committed passage time*
(from the magnitude: committor probabilities)

It is up to the reader trying to understand the origin of these
different behaviors (check section XXX to find some help).



First Committed Passage Time distribution
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In Physics of stochastic processes the *committor probability*,
*C_{a,b}*, is the probability of going from *b* to *a* without passing
through any other state. Based on this idea, we can compute the first
passage time from a state *b* to *a* with a requirement: passing or
not by other states.

In this tutorial we defined 3 macro-states or clusters from a 1D
trajectory (see above). And in our naive first analysis we made an
observation: to go from cluster 0 (green) to cluster 2 (blue), a visit
to cluster 1 (orange) is needed. For the sake of completeness lets
study the first passage time of going from 0 to 2 with and without
passing by cluster 1.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [27]: fcptx012,fcpty012=kin_test.first_committed_passage_time(traj='clusters',\
      ....:   states=[0,1,2],commitment=[True,True,True],norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 888.282178077 frames.

   In [28]: fcptx0no12,fcpty0no12=kin_test.first_committed_passage_time(traj='clusters',\
      ....:   states=[0,1,2],commitment=[True,False,True],norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 861.446234118 frames.

.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/fcpt_bad_0to2.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %

The first passage time distribution of going from 0 to 2 without
passing by 1 it is not negligible as we assumed at the begining of
this tutorial just looking at the histogram.

The kinetic model shows also a similar behavior:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [29]: fcptbwx012,fcptbwy012=bw.first_committed_passage_time(states=[0,1,2],\
      ....:   commitment=[True,True,True],norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 705.085477589 frames.

   In [30]: fcptbwx0no12,fcptbwy0no12=bw.first_committed_passage_time(states=[0,1,2],\
      ....:   commitment=[True,False,True],norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 682.339500433 frames.

.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/fcpt_bad_0to2_model.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %


But in this distributions, the life time of each stay in 0 is included
(as with the first passage time). Let see how in the next section we
can remove this the several independent trips origin by this fact.



Trip Time distribution
++++++++++++++++++++++

An other kinetic magnitude we can observe is the time distribution of
those segments of trajectory in between the stay of an initial cluster
or macro-state and the arrival to an other certain cluster. In this
case, unlike the first passage time, not every single step in the
initial cluster accounts for the distribution.

Lets check the trip time distribution from cluster 0 to cluster 2:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [31]: tt02x,tt02y=kin_test.trip_time(traj='clusters',from_state=0,to_state=2,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 295.365182591 frames.

   In [32]: ttbw02x,ttbw02y=bw.trip_time(from_state=0,to_state=2,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 33.0993065874 frames.

.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/tt_bad_0to2_1.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %

Once more the kinetics observed in the model is different from what
can be computed in the trajectory. This observation points, once again,
to the fact of having a wrong built kinetic model.

While in the kinetic model the trip time looks like single
exponential, two different time scales (two different mechanisms
driving the particle from 0 to 1) are observed from the
trajectory. And this time is clear that the first fast decay
(steps<=10) is shorter than the tipical life time of the intermediate
cluster 1 (mfpt1~=16). Again, we have evidences of straight 0 to 2
jumps not expected looking at the histogram. This can lead us to
invest our precious time trying to answer: How is this mechanism not
previously expected? But as we will see shortly, this fact it is just
an artifact. In addition, if we look in detail to the distribution
from the trajectory, the point at steps=1 does not take part of any of
the hypothetical mechanisms. Its value (tt(1)) is high enough to be
considered as noise. There is probably 3 different mechanisms, and
only the long time noisy tail makes sense for us given that its time
range is comparable with the life time distribution of the
intermediate cluster 1. 





We could also argue that, if along the trip the initial state is
visited again, this stay is observed as part of the trip. If we want
to discard this events the option 'no_return' is required:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [33]: tt02x,tt02y=kin_test.trip_time(traj='clusters',from_state=0,to_state=2,\
      ....:   no_return=True,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 10.895183175 frames.

   In [34]: ttbw02x,ttbw02y=bw.trip_time(from_state=0,to_state=2,no_return=True,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 15.7288866345 frames.


.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/tt_bad_0to2_2.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %

The observations we can make are the same written above. The kinetic
model does not offer a good representation of the system. Regarding
the clusters trajectory, those jumps observed in just one time step
could be not expected straight transitions. But whats the first
exponential decay? Is it physically meaninful? The next section can
help us to enlight the question.



Committed Trip Time distribution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Similar as it was done for the *first committed passage time* (see
section XXX), we can also study committed trip distributions (see
section above).

Let see the trip time distribution of going from 0 to 2 passing by
cluster 1 or going straightforward without visiting the intermediate
cluster.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [35]: tt012x,tt012y=kin_test.committed_trip_time(traj='clusters',states=[0,1,2],\
      ....:   commitment=[True,True,True],no_return=True,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 12.2196153846 frames.

   In [36]: tt0no12x,tt0no12y=kin_test.committed_trip_time(traj='clusters',states=[0,1,2],\
      ....:   commitment=[True,False,True],no_return=True,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 1.0 frames.

.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/ctt_bad_0to2.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %

It is clear now that the one step trips are straight transitions 0
to 1. We can now state that there are two time scales or mechanisms
over the path 0 to 1 to 2. We can again wonder what the origin of this
is. But as we will see later, there is not such misterious hidden
mechanism, not even logical transitions 0 to 2 with expected standard
stays in cluster 1.

This could not be unveiled just looking at our kinetic model, because
it is not properly built up.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [37]: ttbw012x,ttbw012y=bw.committed_trip_time(states=[0,1,2],\
      ....:   commitment=[True,True,True],no_return=True,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 17.24049217 frames.

   In [38]: ttbw0no12x,ttbw0no12y=bw.committed_trip_time(states=[0,1,2],\
      ....:   commitment=[True,False,True],no_return=True,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 1.0 frames.

.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/ctt_bad_0to2_model.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %

Although there exist straight transitions from 0 to 2 in just one time
step, it is part of the same mechanism (exponential decay). The saving
frequency of the trajectory could be large enough to see straight
transitions when they briefly visited cluster 1. 


It is up to the reader trying to understand the origin of these
different behaviors (in the next section some help can be found).




.. _accurate_kin_dec:

Accurate kinetic decomposition
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The wrong description will change with the saving frequency, the good one no.

We have study along the tutorial a dynamical system which, according
to what was previously computed: we have 3 clusters with strange life
time distributions at short times, with strange first passage times,
and with direct transitions 0 to 1, and with two different mechanisms
of transitions 0 to 1 to 2.

But we have important doubts about our study: the kinetic model does
not reproduce the kinetics from the trajectory. The three cluster with
which the model was built are not well defined. Have a look to a piece
of trajectory to understand all the previous results and conclussions:

.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/traj123.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %

The colors correspond to the three macro-states or clusters comming
from the barriers observed in the histogram (XXX).

It is up to the reader understanding now how the description obtained
before matches with the wrong definition of macro-states.



But the trajectory was a projection onto one dimmension of a dynamics
embedded in a larger dimensional space (2 in this case).  Before
propossing how to get a better description, a better kinetic model,
let see how the system behaves in the original 2 dimmensions:

.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/histo_2d.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %


The trajectory studied was the projection over the black axe. Knowing
now that we can define the three macro-states, clusters or basins of
attraction, with the barriers X=-5.5 and Y=5.5, we can rebuild the histogram:

.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/histo_color_good.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %


We understand now why, trying to understand the mechanisms of
transition 0 to 1 to 2 made no sense. Actually, there are no such
transitions, they were just an artifact.

With these three well defined clusters we can have a look now to the
kinetic magnitudes previously computed for the wrong model.

The order is different. I have to writte before that the kinetics was
absurdo. 0 to 2 was faster than 1 to 2 even with a barrier higher. It
is not possible since it has to go through 1. The times are also different.

Having an apparantly exponential behavior it is not saying that our kinetics is ok.

But can we define a good kinetic model without going to the original
2-dimensional trajectory? The next section shows how this can be done.


And to compare with the kinetic model coming from the 2D trajectory,
the *Global First Passage Time* distribution to cluster blue, and from
green or orange to blue, can be computed. With this aim we can create
a trajectory from a brownian walker over the kinetic network (see XXX).
