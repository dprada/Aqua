**************

The set of python libraries **Aqua** allows us to analyse 1-D
trajectories as it has been propossed by G. Berezovska et al. in
`J. Chem. Phys. 137, 194101 (2012) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4764868>`_. This method unveils the conformational macrostates kinetically
"well defined" (see :ref:`accurate_kin_dec`) and the underlying accurate first
order kinetic model.

The following tutorial shows how this analysis can be easily done with
Aqua.


Getting Aqua
+++++++++++++++++

The indications to download and install these libraries can be found
in :ref:`getting_started_pyn`.

Loading Aqua
+++++++++++++++++

Some basic notions on python will be assumed along this tutorial.
To load this libraries the path to Aqua must be either...

- in your PYTHONPATH variable
- in your script with the first lines:

.. sourcecode:: ipython
   
   import sys
   sys.path.append('/path/to/Aqua')

Once this has been done, Aqua must be imported. As you probably
know, Python can be run from a script or from an ipython session.  This
tutorial as been written as an ipython history of commands. So lets
begin with the proper command to load Aqua:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

     In [1]: from aqua import *



Loading a trajectory
++++++++++++++++++++
	       
Given a file with a 1D trajectory in its second column,
:download:`traj.oup <../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/traj.oup.gz>`,
the class *kinetic_1D_analysis* can be initialized:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [2]: test=kinetic_analysis('traj.oup',columns=1)
   # 999901 frames, 1 particles, 1 dimensions.

Now, the trajectory is stored in the object *test*:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [3]: print test.traj[:,0,0]
   array([-0.91936072,  0.74886578, -1.07525923, ..., -9.09667346, -8.40884264, -8.83918787])

Notice that the test.traj is a numpy array of dimensions:
[test.frames,test.particles,test.dimensions]. This way we can take
advantage of its intrinsic numpy attributes and functions:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [6]: print 'Min.:', test.traj.min(),'   Mean:', test.traj.mean() ,'   Max.:', test.traj.max()
   Min.: -11.4344662381    Mean: -3.40808122446    Max.: 2.78106514618

Our object *test* has the attributes and methods of a
*kinetic_analysis* class. For instance, the histogram can be built as:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [7]: hx,hy=test.histogram(delta=0.20,segment=[-12.0,4.0],norm=False)

And plotted with pylab as:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [8]: import pylab

   In [9]: pylab.plot(hx,hy,'b-')

   In [11]: pylab.show()

   :scale: 70 %


Analysis
++++++++

After loading the trajectory, the method is applied choosing at least
three parameters:

- window: The cumulative distribution of the fluctuations around the time
  step t will be studied in the segment [t-window,t+window].

- bins: The former cumulative distribution has to be built up in a discrete way.

- granularity: The kinetic model obtained will have a degree of
  resolution up to the granularity parameter used by the Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL).


.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [3]: test.berezovska2012(window=10,granularity=1.2,bins=15,verbose=True)
   # Network:
   # 97 nodes
   # 1057 links out
   # 999880.0 total weight nodes
   # Number of clusters:  3

The algorithm decomposes this trajectory into 3 macro-states or
clusters. This way, we can find a clusters trajectory according to
this decomposition.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [4]: print test.traj_clusters[:,0,0]
   [0 0 0 ..., 1 1 1]


Notice that the method dismisses the first and last segments of length
'window=10' time steps.  Thereby, test.traj_clusters[0] corresponds to
test.traj[10].

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [5]: print len(test.traj), len(test.traj_clusters)
   999901 999881


We can now have a look to the histograms of these 3 macro-states.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [6]: hx_c0,hy_c0 = test.histogram(cluster=0,delta=0.20,segment=[-12.0,4.0],norm=False)
   In [7]: hx_c1,hy_c1 = test.histogram(cluster=1,delta=0.20,segment=[-12.0,4.0],norm=False)
   In [8]: hx_c2,hy_c2 = test.histogram(cluster=2,delta=0.20,segment=[-12.0,4.0],norm=False)

Kinetic Model and Flux between clusters
.......................................

A first order kinetic model can be computed with these three
macro-states. The model should be written as a master equation where the
transition probabilities, or rates, between macro-states interplay to
mimic the macroscopical dynamical behavior observed in the 1D trajectory.

.. math::

   \frac{dP_{0}}{dt} = P_{01}P_{1} + P_{02}P_{2} - P_{10}P_{0} - P_{20}P_{0},

\

.. math::

   \frac{dP_{1}}{dt} = P_{10}P_{0} + P_{12}P_{2} - P_{01}P_{1} - P_{21}P_{1},

\

.. math::

   \frac{dP_{2}}{dt} = P_{20}P_{0} + P_{21}P_{1} - P_{02}P_{2} - P_{12}P_{2},

In Aqua this model is enconded as a kinetic or conformational
network.  The trajectory is mapped into a graph where weighted nodes
and directed links accounts for the occupation of clusters and the
number of transitions among them.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [9]: test.kinetic_network(traj='clusters',verbose=True)
   # Network:
   # 3 nodes
   # 7 links out
   # 999880.0 total weight nodes

Before getting the transision probabilities, or rates, detailed
balance condition, :math:`P_{ji}P^{s}_{i}=P_{ij}P^{s}_{j}`, is
impossed symmetrising the network.

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [10]: test.network_clusters.symmetrize(new=False,verbose=False)

The flux, number of transitions along the trajectory, is stored as the
weight of a given link. This way, the flux from cluster 0 to cluster 1:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [28]: test.network_clusters.node[0].link[1]
   264.5

Notice that the number is not an integer due to the symmetrization of the network.

Now, the transition probabilities can be computed normalizing the flux:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [11]: for ii in range(3):
      ....:         ww=test.network_clusters.node[ii].weight
      ....:     for jj,kk in test.network_clusters.node[ii].link.iteritems():
      ....:             if ii!=jj :
      ....:                 print 'P'+str(jj)+str(ii)+'=', kk/ww
      ....: 
   P10= 0.000494643543406
   P20= 7.29342086685e-05
   P01= 0.000937845154496
   P02= 0.00021297277225

Since detailed balance condition is fulfilled by construction, the
stationary solution of the model is given by the occupation
probabilities (:math:`P^{s}_{0}`, :math:`P^{s}_{1}`, :math:`P^{s}_{2}`):

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [12]: ww=test.network_clusters.weight
   In [13]: for ii in range(3):
      ....:     print 'P'+str(ii)+'^s =', test.network_clusters.node[ii].weight/ww
      ....: 
   P0^s = 0.534792675121
   P1^s = 0.282063347602
   P2^s = 0.183143977277


Kinetic observables
...................

Once the analysis has been applied, some kinetic observables can be
computed (see:).  Here we illustrate how they can be computed straight
forward from the 1-D trajectory to be compared with the kinetic model.

The *Global First Passage Time* distribution to a certain cluster, and
the *First Passage Time* distribution from any cluster to it can be
extracted from the trajectory:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [14]: fpt_0_x,fpt_0_y = test.first_passage_time(traj='clusters',to_state=0,\
      ....:   norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 2344.27167283 frames.

   In [15]: fpt_10_x,fpt_10_y = test.first_passage_time(traj='clusters',from_state=1,\
      ....:   to_state=0,norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 1092.77053998 frames.

   In [16]: fpt_20_x,fpt_20_y = test.first_passage_time(traj='clusters',from_state=2,\
      ....:   to_state=0,norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 4258.04559256 frames.


.. figure:: ../../tutorials/kinetic_1D_analysis/fpt_berez_traj.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %

The trajectory of this tutorial is not long enough to have good
statistics. But we can compare these distributions with with those
given by the kinetic model. To do this, the trajectory of a brownian
walker following the transition probabilities of the model is obtained:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [17]: bw_traj=test.network_clusters.brownian_walker(origin=0,length=999880)

Now as we did with the original trajectory:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [18]: bw=kinetic_analysis(bw_traj)
   # 999881 frames, 1 particles, 1 dimensions.

   In [19]: fpt_0_x,fpt_0_y   = bw.first_passage_time(to_state=0,norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 2310.47971147 frames.

   In [20]: fpt_10_x,fpt_10_y = bw.first_passage_time(from_state=1,to_state=0,norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 1028.52939656 frames.

   In [21]: fpt_20_x,fpt_20_y = bw.first_passage_time(from_state=2,to_state=0,norm=False,verbose=True)
   # Mean first passage time: 4692.91090041 frames.
